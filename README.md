API Security

        Authentication

        What it is: Verifying the identity of users or systems attempting to access the API.

        Implementation: We use OAuth2 with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or API keys depending on the service context.

        Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to resources, ensuring that only registered and verified users can interact with the platform.

    Authorization

        What it is: Ensuring that authenticated users only have access to the resources and actions they're permitted to use.

        Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) is applied to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., agent, admin, buyer).

        Why it matters: Protects sensitive endpoints and operations (e.g., listing management, admin controls) from being misused or accessed by unauthorized users.

    Rate Limiting

        What it is: Limiting the number of API requests a client can make in a given timeframe.

        Implementation: We use middleware such as Flask-Limiter or Django Ratelimit to throttle excessive requests.

        Why it matters: Prevents abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and reduces load on the server, ensuring availability for all users.

    Data Validation and Sanitization

        What it is: Validating and cleaning input data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

        Implementation: Strict schema validation using libraries like Marshmallow or Pydantic.

        Why it matters: Prevents injection attacks (SQLi, XSS), malformed data, and application crashes.

    HTTPS Enforcement

        What it is: Ensuring all data transmission between client and server is encrypted.

        Implementation: Enforced HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.

        Why it matters: Protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and keeps user data secure during transit.

    Secure Storage of Credentials

        What it is: Safeguarding sensitive information like passwords and API keys.

        Implementation: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt or Argon2; environment variables are used to store secrets.

        Why it matters: Prevents credential theft in case of a data breach.

    Why Security Matters
    
        User Data Protection: APIs handle sensitive user information (emails, phone numbers, addresses). Proper authentication and encryption ensure this data is not leaked or exposed.
    
        Business Integrity: Preventing unauthorized access protects property listings and financial transactions, preserving trust and compliance.
    
        Platform Availability: Rate limiting and input sanitization defend against abuse and attacks that could bring down services.
    
        Compliance: Adhering to data protection laws (e.g., POPIA, GDPR) is crucial for legal operation and building user trust.

CI/CD Pipeline

    What Are CI/CD Pipelines?
    
    CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It’s a process that automates the steps required to build, test, and deploy code changes.
    
        Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically runs tests and checks every time code is pushed, ensuring that changes don’t break the application.
    
        Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploys approved changes to a staging or production environment after passing all tests.
    
    Why CI/CD Is Important
    
        Faster Development Cycles: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing teams to deliver new features and bug fixes quicker.
    
        Improved Code Quality: Ensures every change is tested automatically, reducing the risk of bugs reaching production.
    
        Reliable Releases: Reduces manual errors during deployment, making releases consistent and predictable.
    
        Scalability: Makes it easier to scale the team and application by providing a reliable pipeline from development to production.
    
    Recommended Tools
    
        GitHub Actions: Automates workflows such as testing, building, and deploying code directly from GitHub.
    
        Docker: Packages the application into containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
    
        Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry: Stores container images that can be used in production.
    
        Heroku / AWS / Render / DigitalOcean: Cloud platforms for automated deployment.
    
        PostgreSQL / Redis / S3: Example backend services that can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline testing and deployment process.
